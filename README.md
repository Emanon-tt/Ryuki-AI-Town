This is a LLM-powered multi-agent simulation framework based on Kamen Rider Ryuki, featuring event-driven orchestration and local model integration via Ollama

## Inspiration & Philosophy:
In the universe of Kamen Rider Ryuki, characters are trapped in an endless cycle of battle. This project aims to 'break the loop' by introducing AI-driven agency. By modeling the intricate interpersonal dependencies (e.g., the bond between Kitaoka and Goro), we allow the simulation to evolve beyond its original script. Each 'Time Vent' in this town isn't a reset, but a new branching path in a latent narrative space.
